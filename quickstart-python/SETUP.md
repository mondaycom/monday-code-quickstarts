## Setup Overview

### Base setup of the app on Monday

To set up the app on Monday, follow these steps:

1. Open monday.com, login to your account and go to the "Developers" section.
2. Create a new "Monday-code Example App".
3. Open the "Features" section and create a new "Integration template" feature.
4. Choose the "Start from scratch" template and name your feature.
5. Create a new build and set the project's exposed URL in the "Base URL" field.
You can use Monday's [tunneling service](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/command-line-interface-cli#mapps-tunnelcreate) to expose your local server txo the internet.
This step is temporary and will be replaced with the URL of your app in monday code.

### Setting authorization URL

1. Under `Feature Details` in your integration feature scroll down to the `Authorization URL` section.
2. Tick the `Enable Authorization URL` checkbox.

2. Enter the `Redirect URLs` tab.
3. Add the following URL: `https://<YOUR_URL>/auth/monday/callback` and **press save**.
4. Don't forget to change the URL after deploying the app to Monday Code.

Congrats, you have successfully set up the app on Monday! ðŸŽ‰

### Deploying the App to Monday Code

1. Go to the `General` tab under monday code, click on `Connect monday code` and follow the instructions on the screen.
2. Choose your integration Feature Under the `Feature` tab, create a new build and choose monday code as the deployment target.

That's it! You have successfully deployed the app to Monday Code. ðŸš€

### Setting up the Environment Variables

1. For setting environment variables in production after deploying to monday-code-
    1. You can set the secrets manually in monday-code by going to the `General` tab under monday code and to the `Environment Variables` section.
    2. Instead, you can use @mondaycom/apps-cli to set the project secrets:
        1. Install apps-cli:
           ```bash
           $ npm i -g @mondaycom/apps-cli
           ```
        2. Set secrets:
           ```bash
           $ mapps code:env
           ```
           Choose the app to set environment variables -> set -> enter the secret key -> then enter the value of the secret.
           The secret will be injected into process.env of your deployment.
2. Set all the needed environment variables for this app, which can be found in the `.env.example` file.

### Creating a Custom Action

1. Choose your integration Feature Under the `Feature` tab, under `Workflow Bloacks` create a new action.
2. Give the action a name, for this example, let's call it `Send an email`.
3. Of course, you can add [Input Fields](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/custom-actions#configure-action-input-fields) based on your requirements.
4. Define a [Sentence](https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/custom-actions#define-action-sentence) for the action, for example, `Send an email to {email}`.
5. Finally, Provide the relative path to the action in the API Configuration section, in our case- `/mail/send`.

### Creating a Recipe

1. Choose your integration Feature Under the `Feature` tab, under `Recipes` create a new recipe.
2. Choose a trigger, for this example, let's choose `When status changes`.
3. Choose the action you created in the previous step, `Send an email`.

That's it! You have successfully created a recipe on Monday!

### Using the recipe

1. Go to a board on Monday and create a new automation.
2. Choose the recipe you created in the previous step.
3. Configure the recipe based on your requirements, in this case, you need to choose a status column.
4. Test the recipe by changing the status of an item.
5. Check the logs in the Monday Code console to see the recipe in action.

### Happy building! ðŸŽ‰
